PebbleRecipe app

Phone:
	Browser or takes url to recipe sites
	Parses info like title, ingredients, and instructions
	Sends that to the watch in very small pieces
	
Watch:
	Just shows info from phone
	Pressing up or down will load more from the phone
	One button will show ingredients, one will show steps


- Send stuff in three separate types(title, ingredients, steps)? Or try to send all at once?

event layout:
    phone starts communication
    watch says it's listening
    while phone has data
        send data
        wait for watch communication
    no more data - tells watch it's finished
    watch can do something else

-the button handlers in the watch aren't working since i switched everything around. i'm not sure where to put them.
-for watch, maybe use a ScrollLayer? I'm not sure if the whole recipe can fit on the watch at once.
