PebbleRecipe app

Phone:
	Browser or takes url to recipe sites
	Parses info like title, ingredients, and instructions
	Sends that to the watch in very small pieces
	
Watch:
	Just shows info from phone
	Pressing up or down will load more from the phone
	One button will show ingredients, one will show steps


- Send stuff in three separate types(title, ingredients, steps)? Or try to send all at once?

event layout:
    phone starts communication
    watch says it's listening
    while phone has data
        send data
        wait for watch communication
    no more data - tells watch it's finished
    watch can do something else

-the button handlers in the watch aren't working since i switched everything around. i'm not sure where to put them.
-for watch, maybe use a ScrollLayer? I'm not sure if the whole recipe can fit on the watch at once.
-!!I'm sending too much data. I should divide the data into big chunks. Each app message will send 800 or so words.!!
    Maybe measure in chunks of 800, but divide so i send the biggest chunk. So first send [800][150] as a chunk, and then
    when they push down send [150][800] as the second chunk.
-can i make a scroll layer for each step? or what.
-maybe one scroll layer. [a][b][c][d][e]. then when scroll past e, take off a & b. so
    [c][d][e][f][g], so that e is in the middle.
